        <p>The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
        <p>That's crazy. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Use your imagination, let it go. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well,what the heck.</p>
